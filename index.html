                    <p>
                        Our creator and owner, Pat Smith, combined two signature Seattle icons:
                        salmon and coffee. Pat used this combination to develop a recipe for a coffee-time confection
                        and called it Salmon Cookies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now Pat brings his creation to our very own Portland, Oregon.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The cookies are not only shaped like salmon, but are actually made with their namesake fish 
                        (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!). They are the ideal match
                        for a steaming cup of coffee on a PNW morning. Or PNW afternoon... Or any time at all!
